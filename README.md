# Money App

## Purpose

This app is meant to serve as a credit card transaction calculator. The problem is Capital One doesn't allow one to view charges of a specific card, in a specific date range. This app is meant to solve that issue. As of right now it requires a manual input of a CSV file from Capital One, but the goal is eventually one won't need to manually put a CSV file in.
